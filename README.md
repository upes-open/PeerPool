# P2P-Carpooling-DAPP

An alternative cab service app to other apps like Ola, and Uber, which control the work environment for drivers and take chunks of cuts from their earnings as commission, making life difficult for a regular driver. This P2P Carpooling DAPP will connect drivers directly with customers to share a ride. The transactions will go through smart contracts run on blockchain technology and paid via cryptocurrency. Anyone can register as a driver and publish rides for people to book. This DAPP makes the process more hassle-free, making it more transparent.
